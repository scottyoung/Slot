Overview:

This is a quick drink slot machine simulator written in HTML5 and jQuery.  In my example, the slot machine has 3 columns, each which 3 objects it can land on.  The first slot is the item - a coffee machine, tea pot, and espresso machine.  The second slot is the medium - coffee filter, tea ball, espresso tamper.  The third slot is item - coffee beans, loose tea, or ground espresso beans.  If a spin aligns all 3 appropriate drink items, you win that (virtual) prize!


Getting Started:

Download all imagess, linked css file, and html file.  Open html file in a browser and click the slot handle to begin.
